DESCRIPTION
=====================================    
This plugin will automatically scan your library for watched TV shows and Movies and delete them from the file system based on numerous critia such as age, rating, disk free space etc.  All these options and more can be configured via add-on settings (right click addon or press C for context menu and select 'Add-on Settings').  Also make sure you set the disk usage path before enabling if you store your videos on a secondary drive (e.g, /media/external or D:\ etc).

TO DO LIST
=====================================
* Allow users to start the addon themselves using the "program addons" feature too.
* Create a single query depending on the type of file to delete (movie/episode). At the moment we write the same query twice, only slightly different.
* Do not catch each and every type of exception, but only the ones we will handle ourselves
* Fix low disk space measuring for non-Windows OSes
* Display one message with the number of files deleted, if more than one, instead of displaying each message individually
