READ BEFORE PROCEEDING
=====================================
This addon has the potential to wipe your entire video collection! Please make sure you understand exactly what this addon is designed to do before enabling the file deletion capabilities in the settings. I will not be held responsible for loss of data due to user error.

DESCRIPTION
=====================================
This addon will automatically scan your library for watched TV shows and Movies and delete them from the file system based on numerous critia such as age, rating, free disk space, etc. All these options and more can be configured via the addon's settings. Also make sure you set the correct path to the disk you wish to check for free space, especially when you store your videos on a secondary drive or a network share.

BUGS
=====================================
* Disk capacity checks are not supported for NFS or SMB shares at the moment.
* Deleting of files does not seem to work for NFS or SMB shares at the moment.
* Music videos do not have ratings, so their ratings are not being checked.

FUTURE IDEAS
=====================================
* Allow users to start the addon themselves using the "program addons" feature too (partially solved by Frodo, which allows launching from addon browser).
* Delete files after a user-determined number of plays instead of the fixed one play.
